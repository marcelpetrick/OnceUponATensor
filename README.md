# OnceUponATensor
A treasury for homemade fairy tales for my children. The bulk of the work was accomplished using generative AI, which contributed to parts of the text, and sometimes even the ideas for the plot and the illustrations. My contributions included curation, polishing, rewriting some sections, and selecting or preparing appropriate images.

Each directory contains all the images, the raw text, the assembled document, and the output as a PDF.

All stories, along with their source material, are open source and free to use under the `GPL-3.0 license`.

## Challenges
Achieving consistent output from DALL-E 3 is quite challenging. Even when the heroes and their outfits or the environment are described in detail, some elements get lost across different scenes. For example, dragons may suddenly change their color, a cat loses its hat, or it proves impossible to place a cat into a cage (in the style of "Hansel and Gretel"). Although other tools like Midjourney or Stable Diffusion with ControlNet offer more control, they require additional effort.
