Hoard for selfmade fairy tales for my children. The heavy lifting was done by generative AI, means parts of the texts, sometimes even the idea for the plot and the illustrations as well. My own input were curation, polishing, rewriting some paragraphs and preparing/picking proper images.

Each directory contains all the images, the raw text, the assembled document and output as PDF.

All stories and with its source-material are open-source and free to use under GPL-3.0.

## Challenges
It is really hard to get consistent output from DALL-E 3: even when you described the heroes and their outfits or the environment in detail, stuff gets lots over rendering different scenes. For instance: dragons suddenly change their color, a cat looses its hat or it was impossible to put a cat into a cage (`HÃ¤nsel & Gretel`-style). Of course, other tools like Midjourney or StableDiffusion with  ControlNet allow more control, but require more effort.
